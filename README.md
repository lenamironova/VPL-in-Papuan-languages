# Verbal Plurality in Papuan Languages

This repository contains a dataset for a typological study of verbal plurality (VPL) in Papuan languages — the non-Austronesian, non-Australian languages of New Guinea and the surrounding islands.

The sample includes 164 languages (42 families, 19 isolates), selected from Glottolog 4.0 (Hammarström et al. 2019) based on the availability of sufficiently detailed grammatical descriptions.  
The dataset is designed to support the analysis of semantic functions and morphological strategies associated with verbal plurality in Papuan languages.

## Dataset

The dataset is structured as follows.

| Column | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **id lang** | Language identifier (unique ID for each language) |
| **id marker** | Marker identifier (unique ID for each verbal plurality marker) |
| **language** | Language name |
| **iso** | ISO 639-3 code |
| **glottocode** | Glottolog code |
| **genealogical information** | Language family or subgroup |
| **latitude / longitude** | Coordinates of the language area |
| **short link / pages / source** | Bibliographic reference |
| **marking** | Specific means of expression of verbal plurality |
| **strategy** | Type of morphological marking (affixation, reduplication, irregular stem alternation, other) |
| **productivity** | Productivity of the marker (productive / restricted / not clear (NC)) |
| **collective / distributive / intRAoccasional / intERoccasional** | Availability of the corresponding interpretations and specific semantic subtypes |
| **number value** | Number of participants and/or repetitions required for a “plural” interpretation (e.g. >1, >2) |
